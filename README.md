## Overview

Create using Python a program which will carry out the Thompsons Construction method on a Regular Expression to a NFA (Non-Deterministic Finite Automata). 

## Running the Project

```
cd Project
```

```
python script.py
```

## Research
You can view my research and documentation again within the Project folder under the folder 'docs'. I have written my documentation up by using Jupyter Notebook which i also learned a lot about in the finalisation of this project.

```
cd Project/doc's
```
