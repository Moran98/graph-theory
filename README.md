[![Gitpod Ready-to-Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-Ready--to--Code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/Moran98/graph-theory) 
## Overview

Create using Python a program which will carry out the Thompsons Construction method on a Regular Expression to a NFA (Non-Deterministic Finite Automata). 

## Running the Project

```
cd Project
```

## Command Line Arguments
To access the programs --help command line arguments use the following command :

````
python script.py -h
````

````
python script.py --help
````

These commands will guide you in the steps to running the program and testing by passing in the initial commands for Infix and String : 

````
python script.py infix , String
````



## Research
You can view my research and documentation again within the Project folder under the folder 'docs'. I have written my documentation up by using Jupyter Notebook which i also learned a lot about in the finalisation of this project.

```
cd Project/doc's
```
